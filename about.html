            <p>My name is Isabel Maria Guner-Velasco and I am a professional musician turned software developer.</p>
            <p>I have always been interested in using ICT resources when teaching music because the Internet and new technologies offer fantastic tools that I could use for the benefit and enjoyment of my students.</p> 
            <p>Being an end user, however, was not enough for me and I wanted to see how technology works behind the scenes. This curiosity combined with the circumstances of the pandemic contributed to my decision to switch careers and learn coding.</p>
            <p>In the last two years I contributed to two comercial websites. currently enrolled in the Front-end development program at Noroff: School of technology and digital media.</p>
